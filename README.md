# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to find the total number of employees eligible for retirement in each department.
Then we must identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program which will help eliviate the transition and prepare for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results
- First we created a list of retiring employees by title by creating a table called retirement_titles. 
- Then we created another table called unique_titles that gave us employees names, and titles and with that information we created a third table called retiring_titles. 
- In retiring_titles, we can see the number of people eligible for retirement based on title. We learned that senior engineers and senior staff have the highest number with 29,000 and 28,000 people under each title. 
- We then created another table titled mentorship_eligibility where we looked at current employees with specific birthdates to see who might be a good candidate for the mentorship program to replace some of the retirees.

## Summary
In summary, the "silver tsunami" will affect the senior engineers and senior staff the most. There is a good list of eligible employees to begin the mentorship program and hopefully ease the "silver tsunami" transition. This information is also helpful for HR to see which departments they will need to focus on hiring for before and during the "silver tsunami".
